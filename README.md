Project Title: Detecting Phishing Websites Using Machine Learning

Motivation:
The driving force behind our project is the urgent need to confront the widespread menace of phishing attacks on the internet. These malicious activities jeopardize both personal and financial information, resulting in substantial financial losses, identity theft, and data breaches. The urgency to address this issue is underscored by its critical implications for safeguarding personal data, ensuring financial security, preventing data breaches, averting identity theft, and fostering cybersecurity education.

Significance:
Our project endeavors to craft a machine learning-based system designed to predict phishing websites. This proactive strategy is geared towards enhancing online safety and security, providing users with the tools to make informed decisions when interacting with websites. The paramount significance of our initiative lies in shielding individuals from unauthorized access, financial harm, and identity theft. Concurrently, it serves to raise awareness about cybersecurity practices, contributing to a more resilient digital landscape.
